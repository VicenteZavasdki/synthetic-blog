## Cloudflare Deployment

This project uses `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` to deploy Next.js to Cloudflare Pages.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Cloudflare Account**: You need a Cloudflare account.
2.  **Wrangler CLI**: The project includes `wrangler` as a dev dependency, but you can also install it globally.

### Local Development

To preview the application as it would run on Cloudflare:

\`\`\`bash
npm run pages:preview
\`\`\`

### Deployment

To deploy to Cloudflare Pages:

1.  **Build the application:**
    \`\`\`bash
    npm run pages:build
    \`\`\`

2.  **Deploy:**
    \`\`\`bash
    npm run pages:deploy
    \`\`\`

### Configuration

-   **Compatibility Flags**: Ensure your Cloudflare Pages project has the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag enabled.
-   **Environment Variables**: Set your environment variables in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard.
-   **Wrangler Configuration**: A `wrangler.toml` file is included to handle compatibility flags and build output settings automatically.
